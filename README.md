# GAN-Practice
Python files `gan.py` and `wgan.py` are the modified practice code of the online course "Indroduction to Deep Learning and PyTorch" offered by Liangqu Long, the course link can be found at [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17Z4y1T7sz?p=130). 

Python files `my_first_gan.py` and `dcgan.py` are practice code of "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization" on coursera which can be found at [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans?action=enroll&utm_campaign=SocialAndrewGANs&utm_medium=institutions&utm_source=deeplearningai).

The implementation of spectral normalization in directory `sngan` is borrowed from this [repo](https://github.com/christiancosgrove/pytorch-spectral-normalization-gan).
